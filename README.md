# Student-Record-System
The project deals with storing and retrieving of student details such as student USN, Name Branch, Sem etc., in files using chain hashing.
In the chaining approach, the hash table is an array of linked lists i.e., each index has its own linked list. 
Whenever a student with same branch appears then the collision occurs. But using chain hashing that record will be stored in the same index by creating a new list.
